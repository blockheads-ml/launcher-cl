# First Release Candidate Installer 
**-->** https://github.com/blockheads-ml/launcher-cl/raw/master/CL_Launcher_Installer.exe **<--**

This release candidate comes packed with the bootstrapped auto-updater. Not only does it auto update the mod packs, it also auto-updates the launcher itself. This is the only install you will ever need. It will automatically pull changes to the launcher, mod packs, servers and so much more.
